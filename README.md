# zapnet

## Building

Ideally you would use Visual Studio 2017/2019 to build Zapnet.

1. You will need to add a reference to UnityEngine.dll which can be found in your local installation of Unity.
2. You will then be able to build using either the Release or Debug configurations.

Output files can be found in the `Build/` directory.
